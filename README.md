# SCCM_PowerShell_scripts

This is a collection of SCCM scripts that I've written or found to help work with Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) / Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.

PowerShell and SCCM, two great products that work great together!

If you see something you can improve, feel free to do it, it won't hurt my feelings. :)

Hopefully someone out there stumbles across this code and can use it to help themselves.

I'm sure there are some modules or code that came from the web, and if you see code that you wrote and I didn't note it, please do so.
